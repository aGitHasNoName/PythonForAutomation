In class, I will give you some commands to set up your home directory with the files weâ€™re using today, but if you want to get a headstart, here are the four lines of code you will need to run on Quest to pull in the files:

module load parallel
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aGitHasNoName/PythonForAutomation/main/questFiles.txt
parallel wget {} :::: questFiles.txt
